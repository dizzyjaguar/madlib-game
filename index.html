    <div id="madlib-full">Concerning Pipe-weed 

    There is another <span id="adjective1">astonishing</span> thing about <span id="fantasy-species1">Hobbits</span> of old that must be 
    mentioned, a/an <span id="adjective2"> astonishing </span> habit: they <span id="past-tense-verb1">imbibed</span> or inhaled, through pipes of 
    <span id="natural-material1"> clay </span> or <span id="natural-material2"> wood </span>, the smoke of the burning leaves of a herb, which they called 
    pipe-weed or <span id="marijuana-strain-1"> leaf </span>, a variety probably of Nicotiana or Marijuana. A great deal of mystery 
    surrounds the origin of this <span id="adjective3"> peculiar </span> custom, or 'art' as the <span id="fantasy-species1"> Hobbits </span>
    preferred to call it. All that could be discovered about it in antiquity was 
    put together by <span id="name-of-famous-person"> Brandybuck </span> (later Master of <span id="fastasy-country"> Buckland </span>), and since he 
    and the <span id="marijuana-strain-1"> tobacco </span> of the Southfarthing play a part in the history that 
    follows, <span id="name-of-famous-person"> his </span> remarks in the introduction to his Herblore of the Shire may be 
    quoted.
